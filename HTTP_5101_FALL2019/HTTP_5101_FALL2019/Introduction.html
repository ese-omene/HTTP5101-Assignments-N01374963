            <h1>This is my first HTML web page!</h1>
            <p>HTML is a scripting language that allows people to put static information on the internet.</p>
            <p>The information on static pages won't change. Some examples of static websites include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brochure Pages</li>
                <li>About Pages</li>
                <li>"Frequently Asked Questions" Pages</li>
                <li>Pages like the one you're on now!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Static pages are the simplest type of webpages.</p>

            You can write information here and it won't show up on the website.
            For example:
            TO DO : Add CSS styling to this page!

            <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
            <p>Below is an image chart which reflects the "big picture" of web development. It may be scary to look at first, but we will work through it over this semester. It includes the common different languages you must learn as well as why you must learn them and how they interact with each other. Each week as we progress through our knowledge I will continue to highlight this diagram.</p>
